# coalescence

Scattered knowledge...
Wasted time, 
lost in the immensity of it all...
Voices raising in disharmony... 
A new order today...

The simple guide of life 
We wished existed
Guidelines are : 
Keep it simple 
No surplus but alternatives, something for everyone
Keep it sweet and tasty
Keep it realistic 
Cover every area of life, question brings answer 
List multiple sources for each statement
For each link, an summary
